People who share certain characteristics and perspectives require a degree of separation in order to build and sustain subcultures. Being part of a group can make it much easier to coordinate with others, and be build networks based on trust. It can also mean enabling a unique and specific culture and norms, a quality of diversity that may otherwise be washed away within the mainstream.</p></div><figure class="block-animation-none"><blockquote data-animation-role="quote"><span>“</span>Respect is not synonymous with inclusion. Think of an evening out with family, an evening out with friends, people you feel comfortable with. Part of the pleasure is the selectivity: you are with your people.

Someone ‘wandering by’ a conversation, particularly in the online world these days, may find such discussion alarming or insensitive if they have different values or culture. However, one should not apply one’s own cultural norms or values to other groups, or expect them to communicate in the same way that one would think common. It can be very misleading to pull a snippet of conversation from a place with one set of norms, for it to be appraised somewhere else.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap">One should not be judged based upon who one happens to follow or is connected to. Merely following someone’s tweets or retweeting a single statement, etc, should not be taken as a tacit endorsement of someone else’s character or beliefs. Some folks like to culture a broad set of inputs, or may respect someone’s professional achievements without necessarily agreeing with their values.<br><br>Similarly, a network or group should not be judged by the actions of a small minority within it, unless the larger group is explicitly shown to approve of those actions.

If one starts censoring one thing ‘for the common good’, it’s a very slippery slope towards censoring almost anything potentially controversial or objectionable to someone, somewhere.

Most industrialised nations forbid discrimination in housing, education, and employment based on various protected characteristics, and it may be just and necessary for political orientation to become a protected characteristic also.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap"><em>Peace requires ensuring equality of access to the pillars upon which a successful life is built.</em></p><pre><code><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=19cz9kbOIkMxzBOjzvuvoj6uDLfAGS5hyggtDUUYiUuc" target="_blank">[Make a Comment]</a></code></pre><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap"></p></div><p id="Principle6"></p><div><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap"><strong>Judicial Reporting Embargo.</strong></h3><p style="white-space:pre-wrap">A moderate level of sexuality in an appropriate context should be tolerated, and we should be careful not to demonise it. It is normal for people to scope each other out, and sometimes such processes may be clumsy and unwelcome. Unless someone is being a serious threat, stalking, or a nuisance, we should forgive unrequited interest. Generally a polite rebuff is sufficient, and it is unjust to attack someone merely for trying. One should not apply an ideological lens to shame innocent, normal, natural behaviour.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap">Court cases for alleged crimes of a sexual nature, or alleged crimes which are heavily politicised, should not be reported upon until a verdict is reached. No-one should be judged in the court of human opinion, and no jurist today can reasonably be expected to successfully avoid contact with news and influence from the opinions of others.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap">The justice system by and large works well until a case is politicized and tried in the media. It's not equipped to control for that. Today, journalists are increasingly acting more as <a href="https://quillette.com/2018/07/05/journalism-is-not-activism/" target="_blank">activists rather than reporters</a>. Hearsay and accusations should never be used to convict someone in a court of public opinion regardless of any legal judgment. Such cases create a ‘<a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/10/30/sort-by-controversial/" target="_blank">scissor issue</a>’ which <a href="https://medium.com/handwaving-freakoutery/facebook-is-shiris-scissor-e78413457d2c" target="_blank">threatens to rupture society further</a>, as two extremely indignant groups move to defend their preferred position.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap">In the past, when a juror in a case was obliged to avoid paying attention to the news, not reading the newspaper or watching TV would be enough. Today with so much of our news coming from social media, news is almost inescapable. This is particularly important in a time when <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/11/us/ronald-sullivan-harvard.html?smtyp=cur&amp;smid=tw-nytimes" target="_blank">even lawyers representing defendants as part of due process</a> are being targeted for career or <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/news/538778-trump-lawyer-van-der-veen-says-his-house-was-attacked-hes-faced-death-threats" target="_blank">domestic</a> destruction in sensitive cases.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap">Media reporting of sensitive cases prior to or pending judgment is damaging to the process of justice, and it is also <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_WhatsApp_lynchings" target="_blank">damaging to our society and innocent people</a>. Judges should consider if media coverage ought to be embargoed <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/richard-jewell-the-1996-olympic-bomb-attack-and-the-hero-who-became-a-villain-11920671" target="_blank">until a legal judgment</a> has been declared. If further litigants are inspired to come forward they may then do so after a judgment on the first matter has been settled. We must thoughtfully weigh this against society's need to enable large groups of plaintiffs to collectively pursue legal action against those who may have committed widespread offenses, even if they were never formally charged.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap">Gibbeting someone’s reputation is unacceptable, and hysteria related to hard cases can potentially lead to <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Indian_WhatsApp_lynchings" target="_blank">lynching of people themselves</a>. This is particularly troublesome in a world where police themselves are increasingly getting involved in policing ‘<a href="https://www.faircop.org.uk/" target="_blank">non-crime crime</a>’. Many issues of a sensitive nature are today being held in non-judicial contexts, such as private hearings within academia. To satisfy due process, a private hearing must be a real one, not a sham or pretense. Those adjudicating have a solemn duty of responsibility to invest proper attention to the matter. Participants must be given access to sufficient information to satisfy their defense, and prosecutors must not declare any new charges that have not come directly from the individual making the original accusation.<br><br>Such private hearings should be able to be decided within a court of law instead, if so any judgment of the hearing should not take effect until the matter has been decided in a formal public hearing.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap">Finally, the <a href="http://www.fakehatecrimes.org/fakes" target="_blank">invention of provably false (or overinflated) claims</a> in order to <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/02/jussie-smollett-story-shows-rise-victimhood-culture/583099/">gain prestige or support</a> must be subject to stringent prosecution, along with public excoriation. If a crime is afforded an aggravated status as being also a hate crime, the injured party in this aspect is <em>not</em> the person to which the primary crime pertains. Rather, the wounded party in a hate crime is society at large. A hate crime injures all of us by our collective dismay and consequential diminished social trust.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap">For this reason, the false reporting (or fraudulent commission) of a hate crime is itself a hate crime, and it must be judged as such. Irrespective of whether police time is wasted or not, or if any particular party is <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/france-samuel-paty-beheading-schoolgirl-b1814372.html" target="_blank">falsely named</a>, the costs to society from diminished social trust are immense. Legislators should consider that the reckless or bad faith creation of false reports of hate, or politically or ethnically motivated hoaxes, ought to be legislated against as a <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Public-order_crime" target="_blank">public order offense.</a></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap"><em>Peace requires the strict implementation of impartial justice adjudicated in a court of one’s unbiased peers.</em></p><pre><code><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=14uVTsfRSCtAl6RbP9Xwx22lNRtYgooZ58O_heX9F4So" target="_blank">[Make a Comment]</a></code></pre><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap"></p></div><p id="Principle7"></p><div><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap"><strong>Statute of Limitations</strong>.</h3><p style="white-space:pre-wrap">Cultural expectations and rules are changing rapidly.

Private business transactions involving one-on-one contracts, membership clubs, and consultations, occur on private property exclusively. That's why private country clubs are allowed for example to be discriminating in terms of their membership, and individuals can choose to enter into contractual relationships using whatever criteria of discrimination they prefer, similarly to how one has the right to refuse entrance to one’s home. But if a venture is open to the general public, and business relies upon custom from random strangers wandering in, it should not be permitted to be partisan or discriminatory due to the social contract of public benefit that affords public corporations their unique blend of privileges and duties.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap">If people feel that they are being cheated out of a fair and equitable life, they will lose hope in the future for them and their children, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-ROZ1Hb8Ic" target="_blank">instead grow in frustration</a> (NSFW), resentment, and <a href="https://youtu.be/RMNmmQjXGao?t=48" target="_blank">destroyed livelihoods</a>. <a href="https://www.projectveritas.com/video/deep-state-unmasked-irs-officials-you-should-give-increased-scrutiny-to-conservative-groups-i-dont-give-a-st-if-that-is-a-crime/" target="_blank">Governmental</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmYwgqlDolA" target="_blank">economic gatekeepers</a> must not use their power and influence to <a href="https://quillette.com/2019/03/12/down-the-rabbit-hole-of-political-intolerance-in-silicon-valley-an-interview-with-blake-harris/" target="_blank">support partisan interests</a>.

Contamination by proxy is unjust and invalid.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap">Many people seek a variety of opinions and ideas to take inspiration and guidance from. Even ideas or opinions that are dismissed as being incorrect might retain a grain of truth, or an unusual perspective. Even a bad idea can still be interesting, and it might serve as a jumping-off point to explore a space of uncharted thought where better ideas might lie.<br><br>In a time of with-us-or-against-us polarization, there is a tendency to police the attention of others – to root out signs of potential dissent. This is an increasingly prevalent practice in the online world, where who has viewed or acknowledged content is often transparent information.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap">It can be very complicated to unpack why someone may have made note of something. Are they acknowledging the content, or the person sharing it? A like may not be an endorsement or agreement, merely an 'I hear what you’re saying’. Is someone ‘angry’ at an incident itself, or the way that someone talked about it?</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap">Norms of communication differ by platform, as well as demography, and over time. A Twitter ‘heart’ <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/3/9661180/twitter-vine-favorite-fav-likes-hearts" target="_blank">was once a ‘favorite’</a> instead, a neutral selector commonly used to earmark posts. Old favorited tweets have been used to attack people and attempt to smear them as ‘loving’ objectionable views. This is an error of judgment, but the underlying act of policing of someone’s personal curation of the content they encounter is itself an error of morals.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap"><em>Peace requires that we allow others to listen to a diverse variety of voices, so that human beings can be empowered to draw their own personal conclusions by syncretising from a selection of evidence.</em></p><pre><code><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NXEgos4oTdTyCFMKsgaqK_X9_-KSTUNS8ikDSa0I3qc/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">[Make a Comment]</a></code></pre></div><p id="Principle14"></p><div><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap">There Are No Monopolies on Truth.</h3><p style="white-space:pre-wrap">No person, identity, or group has a natural monopoly on the truth of a situation. On the contrary, lived experience within a cultural tribe may be reason to take someone’s assertions with a grain of salt.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap">It is often remarked that someone’s lived experience should always be given primacy in a situation; their perspective, based upon their personal experiences, should be afforded the deepest respect and that they should own the definition of what it happening in a situation.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap">However, objective truth is very difficult to discern, and being close to a situation often makes it rather challenging to remain impartial.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap">Therefore, people who have an identity tied up in a situation should simultaneously be given more credence for their opinion (due to their experiences), and also a great deal more wariness towards their assertions, due to the much greater risk of <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Motivated_reasoning" target="_blank">motivated reasoning</a> (e.g. tribal identity politics, receiving a social benefit from being disproportionately aggrieved).</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap">This creates something of a paradox. This paradox is resolved through engagement between persons who are close to a situation in terms of lived experience or identity, and those who are far from it. Only by engaging in good faith dialogue and discussion can something closer to the objective truth of a situation be ascertained, and in so doing find a balance which is more likely to be fair and equitable for everyone.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap">Similarly, people in a particular demographic may feel that their experience generalizes to all other people in that demographic, and that they can speak for all, which is doubtful. Opinions and experiences should always be a personal matter, avoiding any claim upon those of other people.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap"><em>Peace requires acknowledging that having an identity tied up in a situation does not entitle one to a monopoly on the truth of it. Rather, such truth may best be located in dialogue between different groups, some close to a situation, some far from it.</em></p><pre><code><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HGhclF9F53nEHjaIOugxl1Ob5fJsfMnqyW2DW6rk3oE/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">[Make a Comment]</a></code></pre><p style="white-space:pre-wrap"><br><br><br><br></p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap">What are your thoughts?
